## TOROID FONT ##
As a computer programmer that doesn't get enough sleep, my eyes are beginning to suffer. In order to help ease the strain that they experience each day, I have selected the [Droid fonts](http://www.droidfonts.com) to display text for me on my computer screens. However, the one feature that I require which is missing from the Droid fonts is the [slashed zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slashed_zero). Therefore, I have added the slash and the result is the Toroid font.

I'm no graphic designer; and though my change is not significant, I expect that it still needs some work.

## Toroid Fonts are Droid Fonts with Slashed Zeros ##
The Droid fonts were designed by Steve Matteson, Type Director of [Ascender Corp](http://ascendercorp.com/).

### Droid Sans ###
Droid Sans is a humanist sans serif typeface. It was designed with an upright stress, open forms, and a neutral--yet friendly--appearance. Droid Sans was optimized for user interfaces and to be comfortable for reading on a mobile handset in menus, web browsers, and other screen text.

### Droid Sans Mono ###
Droid Sans Mono is a fixed width version of Droid Sans. The Droid Sans Mono fonts feature non-proportional spacing for displaying text in a tabular setting and other uses where a monospaced font is desired. Droid Sans Mono has excellent legibility characteristics in its letterforms.

### Droid Serif ###
The Droid Serif font family features a contemporary appearance and was designed for comfortable reading on screen. Droid Serif features slightly condensed letterforms to maximize the amount of text displayed on small screens. Vertical stress, sturdy serifs, and open forms contribute to the readability of Droid Serif while its proportion and overall design complement its companion, Droid Sans.
